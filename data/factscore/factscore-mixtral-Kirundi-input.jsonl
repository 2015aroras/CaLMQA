{"topic": "How do they know how hot the earth's core is?", "output": "Sure, here is the translation of the answer from Kirundi into English, making it sound as natural as possible:\n\nTo determine the temperature inside the Earth's core, scientists use a combination of indirect methods. They study seismic waves generated by earthquakes, which travel through the Earth and provide clues about its internal structure and temperature. Additionally, laboratory experiments that simulate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of the Earth's interior help scientists understand the behavior of materials at such extreme conditions. By combining these methods, scientists estimate that the temperature at the Earth's core can reach up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,000 degrees Celsius)."}
