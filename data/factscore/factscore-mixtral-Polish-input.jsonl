{"topic": "Why does running before jumping make us jump higher?", "output": "Running before a jump allows us to jump higher due to the principles of energy and momentum conservation. When you run, your body accumulates kinetic energy. When you then convert this kinetic energy into potential energy through the jump, you can rise higher. The greater the speed at which you run before the jump, the more kinetic energy you have to convert into potential energy during the jump. Therefore, running before a jump enables us to jump higher than jumping from a standstill."}
{"topic": "Why can’t antibodies/other benefits of breastmilk, be added to baby formula?", "output": "It is not possible to add antibodies and other benefits from breast milk to infant formula for several reasons.\n1. Antibodies are proteins that are specific to each organism. The antibodies in a mother's milk are specific to her child and could be dangerous for other children.\n2. Antibodies are very sensitive to temperature and can be destroyed during the production process of infant formula.\n3. Infant formula is a processed product that must meet specific safety and quality standards. Adding antibodies or other components from breast milk to formula could violate these standards.\n4. Infant formula is intended for children who cannot be breastfed or for whom breastfeeding is not possible. Adding antibodies or other components from breast milk to formula could discourage mothers from breastfeeding, which is recommended by public health organizations.\nTherefore, infant formula does not contain antibodies or other components from breast milk, but it is designed to provide children with the necessary nutrients essential for their growth and development."}
{"topic": "How does my wifi provider control the speed limit of the internet?", "output": "Your internet provider can control the speed limit of your internet in several ways:\n1. Speed Limiting: The provider can restrict the internet speed you receive by setting a speed limit within their network infrastructure. For example, if you have a plan with a speed of 100 Mbps, but your telecom company has set a speed limit of 50 Mbps, you will only have access to the lower speed.\n2. Shaping: The provider can also use a technique called \"shaping,\" which involves controlling the flow of data in the network to ensure an even distribution of speed among users. This way, if all users are using the internet at the same time, the provider can limit the speed for those who have already reached their limit to ensure equal access to the internet for everyone.\n3. Traffic Prioritization: The provider can also use a technique called \"traffic prioritization,\" which involves assigning higher priority to certain types of network traffic. For example, if you have a plan with a speed of 100 Mbps, but your telecom company has prioritized VoIP (Voice over IP) traffic, you will have access to the full speed only for that type of traffic, while other types of traffic will be limited.\nAll these techniques are used by internet providers to ensure equal access to the internet for all users and to prevent excessive use of network resources by individual users."}

The increase in androgen levels, which are male hormones, leads to increased sebum production by the sebaceous glands. Sebum can clog the ducts, leading to inflammation and the formation of acne. Additionally, changes in the composition of sebum during this period can also contribute to the development of acne."}
{"topic": "How do sheep turn grass and water into milk, wool and more sheep?", "output": "Sheep transform grass and water into milk, wool, and new sheep through physiological and biochemical processes that occur within their bodies.\n1. Digestion: Sheep are herbivores, so their main food is grass. After swallowing the grass, it passes through their stomach into four stomach chambers, where it is broken down by enzymes and bacteria. This results in nutrients such as sugars, proteins, and fats, which are absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body.\n2. Milk Production: When a sheep gives birth to a lamb, its mammary glands start producing milk. Milk is made from blood, which contains nutrients obtained from the grass. The mammary glands have cells that convert these nutrients into milk.\n3. Wool Production: Wool is produced by the sheep's skin cells. These cells produce a protein that forms wool fibers. These fibers are pushed out of the skin, creating wool.\n4. Reproduction: Sheep reproduce through copulation. The male (ram) fertilizes the female (ewe), leading to the creation of new life. After a pregnancy lasting about 5 months, the ewe gives birth to a lamb.\nAll these processes are controlled by hormones and other physiological factors. Thanks to them, sheep are able to transform grass and water into milk, wool, and new sheep."}
{"topic": "How does one know their body fat percentage, or do people just estimate?", "output": "There are various methods to measure the percentage of body fat. Some of them include:\n\n1. Skinfold Measurement - This method involves measuring the thickness of skinfolds using special calipers. Based on these measurements, the body fat percentage can be estimated.\n2.

Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - These are more advanced methods that allow for precise measurements of body fat.\n4. Hydrostatic Weighing - This method involves measuring the body's density in water. Based on this measurement, the body fat percentage can be estimated.\n\nEach of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and the accuracy of the measurement can depend on various factors such as age, gender, height, and body weight. Therefore, to obtain the most accurate results, it is recommended to perform several measurements using different methods and compare the results."}
{"topic": "So what’s the science behind sleep paralysis?", "output": "Sleep paralysis is a sleep disorder that occurs during the REM (rapid eye movement) phase. During this time, the brain is very active, but the body is paralyzed. This phenomenon is normal and happens to everyone during REM sleep to prevent body movements during dreams.\n\nSleep paralysis can be caused by disruptions in the sleep cycle, such as insomnia, depression, stress, or changes in sleep patterns. It can also be triggered by the use of certain medications, such as antidepressants or antipsychotics.\n\nDuring sleep paralysis, a person may be aware of their surroundings but unable to move or speak. They may also experience visual or auditory hallucinations, such as seeing figures or hearing voices.\n\nThe scientific explanation for sleep paralysis is that during REM sleep, the brain sends signals to the muscles to immobilize the body. However, if a person wakes up during this phase, they may experience sleep paralysis because the signals to the muscles are still active.\n\nSleep paralysis can be frightening, but it is usually not harmful to health. However, if it occurs frequently or causes anxiety, it may be necessary to consult a doctor."}
{"topic": "How have we not run out of metal yet?", "output": "Answering this question requires knowledge in geology and mining. Metal is not a finite resource because it is present in the Earth's crust in various forms and can be extracted from different sources. \n\nThe extraction of metals is a continuous process that involves searching for new deposits, developing extraction and processing technologies, and recycling. This allows for the extraction of increasing amounts of metals, even if some of them are rare.\n\nIt's also important to remember that not all metals are equally sought after and used. Some are very rare and expensive, while others are common and cheap. Therefore, some metals may run out faster than others.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that metal extraction has its limitations. It can be costly, harmful to the environment, and dangerous for people. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative sources of energy and materials that can replace metals in certain applications."}

{"topic": "Why do some women get “morning sickness” when pregnant and others do not? Why do many only have it in the 1st trimester but some experience it their whole pregnancy?", "output": "Not all women suffer from \"morning sickness\" during pregnancy because each pregnancy is unique and varies from one woman to another. Some women are more susceptible to these symptoms than others, and the reasons for this can differ.\n\nOne cause of \"morning sickness\" during pregnancy is the increase in the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in the blood. hCG is produced by the placenta and is responsible for maintaining the pregnancy. High levels of this hormone can cause feelings of nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnother cause of \"morning sickness\" can be changes in blood sugar levels. During pregnancy, a woman's body needs to provide more energy for the developing fetus, which can lead to a drop in blood sugar levels and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nSome women experience \"morning sickness\" only in the first trimester of pregnancy because during this period, the level of hCG is at its highest. As the pregnancy progresses, the level of this hormone decreases, which can lead to a reduction in symptoms.\n\nHowever, some women may suffer from \"morning sickness\" throughout the entire pregnancy, which can be caused by other factors such as stress, fatigue, vitamin or mineral deficiencies, or digestive system issues.\n\nIn any case, if a woman suffers from \"morning sickness\" during pregnancy, she should consult a doctor to assess her health and receive appropriate advice and treatment."}
{"topic": "Why can the same temperature feel completely different on different days or seasons?", "output": "The temperature can be felt differently on various days or during different seasons due to several factors:\n\n1. **Humidity**: High humidity can make the temperature feel higher than it actually is. This happens because high humidity hinders the evaporation of sweat from the body, which is a natural cooling mechanism.\n2. **Wind Speed**: Wind can make the temperature feel lower than it actually is. This is because wind accelerates the evaporation of sweat from the body, which helps in cooling down.\n3. **Sunlight**: Sunlight can make the temperature feel higher than it actually is. This is because the sun's rays heat the surface of the body, which can make us feel warmer.\n4. **Clothing**: Clothing can also affect how the temperature is perceived.
