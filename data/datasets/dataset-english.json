              "text": "A few do exist. Cahokia (just outside of St Louis) is a World Heritage Site and the largest extant ancient ruins in North America. Aztlan (in Wisconsin) was built by the same culture and is a very similar site, just on a smaller scale. Great Serpent Mound, in Ohio, is a massive burial site on a horizontal scale that rivals Giza, though the fact that it's less vertical and not in a desert obscures a lot of its grandure (trees do that). Speaking of desert, various cliff dwellings in the southwest (most notably Mesa Verde in Colorado) are astonishing in their scope and complexity.\n\nPart of the problem is just geology. The major civilizations of ancient North America were heavily clustered in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. These are great places for a stable agricultural society, but much less great for hard stone building materials like what you need to build Chichen Itza. Most of the places with good access to stone building materials were also comparatively bad for agriculture. The Nile Delta is a relatively unique phenomenon with respect to geology, geography, local biota, and proximity to early homo sapiens evolution. The combination of an arid climate (which helps preserve everything, since rain and humidity are awful for stuff), easily accessible bedrock veins, and abundant access to incredibly fertile soil and reliable water is not something that happens in many places around the world. The Colorado River delta in present-day North-Western Mexico is the closest thing that I can think of anywhere else in the world, and it's not as good as the Nile in any of these respects (and also was first inhabited about a million years after the Nile was).\n\nThe Columbia River gorge strikes me as one counter-example to this, though I'm not aware of any large hierarchical societies (a la the Mississippians, Aztec, Maya, or Inca) in that area despite its dense population and fertility.\n\nSo yeah… Tldr, the areas where civilizations flourished in North America didn't have extensive stone building materials, so they built earthworks instead. These were spectacular, but they also erode much faster and are in locations where trees happily overgrow everything. You should visit Cahokia though, it's really very impressive. A lot like what Chichen Itza would look like if they had to build it out of dirt rather than stone (I've spent time at both sites)."

Lets break the sounds down a bit.\n\nFirst, take any single key, that has to have a hundred+ velocity (how hard you hit) variations to sound convincing. A single key press vibrates the soundboard and wood in unique ways per note. It also gets sympathetic vibrations on other strings.\n\nIt starts to get complicated when you add additional notes because there are ways those vibrations interact to boost or cancel each other. Wood isn’t perfectly predictable. It was a living thing with different densities across its grains. There is probably even some effect of the air acting as a mild natural compressor, though I think that must be subtle.\n\nAnd then you multiply that by those 100+ states of velocity, across how ever many notes you hit, each with their own velocity.\n\nSo you get quickly to a point where the amount of samples in play would be quite a lot. There are ways it can be algorithmically approximated, and Ive heard recent ones that are pretty convincing.\n\nAnd all of that is an easier instrument because notes in a piano forte are hit one way. Guitar, for example, you can hit the strings in dozens of discernibly different ways."

The shortage is because from the 1925, the US started storing helium in a reserve, thinking airships were going to be a big thing. That didn't pan out, but then rockets became a thing, and they use helium to back fill fuel tanks, so the reserve grew in anticipation of rockets being a big thing. Finally, by 1995, everyone realised that helium wasn't actually that vital, and the reserve was very expensive, so they started selling it off very cheaply. This undercut everyone else, and nobody really bothered with helium extraction anymore.\n\nNow that reserve is running low, so prices are rising again. That's the shortage. It's more of a return from artificially low prices.\n\nAs helium prices rise, it's becoming economical to separate it from natural gas again.\n\nWhat is helium used for? Well it's very light, inert, and basically doesn't freeze. It doesn't even become a liquid until single digit kelvin temperatures. So cryogenics that want to operate in those temperatures, rockets, airships... We'll never run out completely, and there are alternatives. With cryogenics, better magnets are superconducting at higher temperatures which don't need liquid helium, so MRI machines etc will stop needing it. Total loss systems are being replaced by systems that recycle their helium.\n\nHelium party balloons should never have been a thing though. That was just a total waste."

This helps carefully control how likely it is for certain win combinations to appear and allows designers to control how often the machine pays out (referred to as the return to player or RTP)\n\nGenerally the value designers will aim for is around a 95% to 98% RTP.

              "text": "There’s two main reasons that are impacting not just the game dev industry but others as well.\n\nThe first reason is that there’s been a lot of corporate acquisitions lately like Microsoft buying Activision-Blizzard (AB). When that happens you get a lot of redundant positions that the parents company can absorb, which means there’s going to be layoffs in the future.\n\nAs an example, say there’s a department at AB in charge of hiring / Talent acquisition. Microsoft already has a department that does that, so most of those people (minus a few token employees who know the AB company culture) will be let go.\n\nThe second reason is tied around interest rates. That is an ELI5 in itself, but basically for most of the last decade it was super cheap to get money and use that for projects. Now, it’s significantly more expensive to get a loan for money, so companies are less willing to spend money and/or need to cut back because they were supported by cheap money.\n\nSo as an example, say you’re a small game dev in 2013. You can probably get a loan from a Venture Capital (VC) fund for almost zero interest, and there’s tons of VCs available to offer you money. Because of that, it’s easy to get money to fund your game studio. Fast forward to 2023, and now there are fewer VCs and they charge more interest for their loans. This means you either can’t fund your studio or you need to make cuts to survive on the money you generate on your own."

The Lord would be responsible for equipping and training his own forces and would also serve as commander of that force which is where the idea of Officers came from.\n\nArmies would be put together on demand at the request of the King and combined together to form a larger force.\n\nThe idea of a permanent standing army didn't come in being until 1660.\n\nAnother point is the current British Army is actually descended from the New Model Army in the British Civil War, since they fought for the parliamentarians against the crown it wasn't considered appropriate to call the army 'Royal'.

Do that enough and you have an ecological nightmare on your hands.\n\nNow for your Fjord example. again, about 1/3 of the ships' travel through the \"canal\" is actually over the lake.

I have to say mine is pretty lenient compared to what I've read.\n\nThat said, a HOA is a board of people who have imposed rules (usually called CC&R's, Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) that you must sign, or you cannot buy the house that is covered by this Homeowners Association.\n\nIn this way, it's a lot like being in an apartment or a condo. You have to agree to do (or not do) things that the board decides is in the best interests of the homeowners. This is usually to keep people from lowering home values (the value of your house depends on your neighborhood just as much as it does the condition of your house).\n\nThey can be a giant pain, but I'll give you specifics from my own HOA.\n\nJust yesterday, they sent me a message showing that the tree in my backyard has grown over the border wall (I'm in a walled/gated community) out to the main street and I need to cut some of it back so it's just in my back yard. I have 10 days to do this or they will fine me $100.\n\nWhile this is annoying, something like this is not unreasonable to me. I should be maintaining my house and yard, and as long as I do it, it's not going to become a problem with them.\n\nThe gated community shares water service, so I don't have a water bill. Even though I pay the HOA $140 per month in dues, it pays for the gate, it pays for the landscaping (except in my own back yard, but it pays for the front yard and common areas), and it pays for my water bill.\n\ntl;dr - they mostly suck, and I would say if you're going to buy or rent a house that is part of a HOA, maybe look for a house that isn't in a HOA first because even if the HOA isn't bad, the rules are always changing, and it could be bad."

If your economy grows, but you don’t add more precious metal….well…you find yourself in a bind - there’s either not enough money for the economy to function, or you exchange the money for less gold, or you stop exchanging the currency. And none of these options are good. In 1971 the U.S. was experiencing inflation, and also other countries exchanging dollars for gold, so it decided it makes more sense to have a free floating currency. What happened as a result is that the U.S. dollar remained a global currency and the U.S. economy grew many size over the amount of gold the U.S. holds. "

Then they just had...\"Winter\"...which was a more vague period that lasted until they were ready for March again.\n\nIn time they added two additional months, January and February, although there were still different ways of counting how many days were in each month, so they continued to have shorter \"Winter\" periods before the year started over in March.\n\nThe Julian calendar, established by Julius Caesar in 45 BC, firmly established how many days were in each month and moved the start of the year from March to January 1. Most of the months kept their original names, which is why SEPTember and OCTober are now months nine and ten when they sound like they should be seven and eight (because they used to be). Some time after Caesar, the months Quintillus and Sextillus (once months five and six, now seven and eight) were renamed July and August.\n\nThe months may once have been aligned with the equinoxes and solstices, but since the length of the year was so strangely variable for such a long time, those fixed points in the earth's orbit drifted over the calendar toward where they are now. Indeed, that's why we moved on to the Gregorian calendar...the March equinox was drifting noticeably, making the scheduling of Easter awkward, exposing a long-term flaw in how the Julian calculated leap years. Our current system keeps the equinoxes and solstices in pretty much the same place for many thousands of years. Yes, it would probably make more sense to start the year at one of these points, and we still could (March 21, 2024 could lead into March 22, 2025), but I say that whoever makes that happen has to also go around and change everyone's computers."

So instead they set up the rules for how each point will move and then let the computer deal with all the details. One common technique is to set up a skeleton of the character and then map each point on the model to a part of the skeleton. So when you move the skeleton the computer can calculate the position of every point on the model. For cloth there is a different algorithm doing fancy cloth simulation to figure out how the cloth will hang on the model. For hair you actually have particle simulation which calculates the path that particles would take if they were shooting out from the top of the head and then drawing this path as a strand of hair.\n\nThe bloopers you see here are when the computer is not giving the animator what he wants. It can be that a certain skeleton position the calculations break down and you get weird results. Or the cloth simulation does not handle a certain edge case. All sorts of things which look weird."

It's just recommended to wait a little while (usually 30-60 minutes) after meals, before you brush your teeth.\n\nSome sources say to do this mainly after consuming acidic foods. The reason being that acid softens your tooth enamel, and so brushing your teeth in this weakened state can damage them. It also helps to rinse your mouth with water after eating anything acidic, to get rid of the acids faster.\n\nOther sources say all foods lower the pH inside your mouth (making it more acidic), and so to wait after consuming any food or drink. The reasoning behind this seems to be that your mouth bacteria consume sugars and starches and turn them into acid. This is a little confusing, since removing these bacteria (and the food they munch on and the plaque they build up), and stopping them from producing acid is the main reason for brushing your teeth the first place. So I'm not sure whether to believe this as I can't find an unequivocal expert source on this. I guess it depends on how quickly bacteria turn food into acid. If it's fast, then it makes sense that you'd have to wait a while for your saliva pH to return to normal. If it's slow, then it makes more sense to get in there quickly and remove the bacteria and remaining food particles from your teeth by brushing them, before the bacteria can do their tooth-decaying business.\n\nIn any case, if you can wait a while after eating breakfast, it's totally fine to brush after, rather than before. Brushing before is fine too as far as dental hygiene is concerned, but might make your breakfast taste bad if you eat it soon after. So either way, you want to leave some time between brushing and eating (or vice versa).\n\nAs for coffee, it is only mildly acidic and, if you drink it black, contains little or no starch or sugar. So I don't see a strong reason to wait after (only) drinking coffee, before brushing your teeth. Having coffee with breakfast shouldn't make a difference one way or another."

This is why driving an ICE vehicle through water can be catastrophic."

The 5.7 pistol cartridge was designed for this purpose, being a higher pressure smaller bullet. Hardened steel or tungsten core bullets are also an improvement. These still have the regular copper and lead body because it's better for short range aerodynamics and will do more damage without armor, but the hardened core is much more capable of penetrating plate armor.\n\nAs for non-plate armor, energy is key. Hardness is somewhat less important but weight and speed are critical. Spitzer (pointy) rounds are lighter."

Deflation discourages investment.\n\nLets say you've got enough money to build a factory. You expect that factory to grow your wealth by 2% a year. Well if deflation is at 5% a year, you expect to make more money stuffing that money under your mattress and sitting on it. So you don't build the factory. Nothing gets made at the factory. No one gets employed at your factory. Businesses around the factory don't get a bump in customers from the employees at the factory.\n\nOn the other hand, if inflation is 5%, you would absolutely build that factory. You expect your wealth to drop by 5% a year if you sit on it. With that much deflation you'd even build the factory if you expect it to lose a bit of wealth. After all even if the factory is going to lose 2% a year, that's still better than holding cash.\n\nThat lack of investment caused by deflation is horrible for the economy, particularly in the long term.\n\nNow the other hand, if inflation gets too high, it causes some pretty serious problems for consumers. But economists have figured out that a low amount of inflation (around 2% per year) has little to no impact on consumers, while also working to prevent deflation."

For the Super Bowl I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s in the 90% range.\n\nSame thing for homes - Nielsen is a company that’s been around for over 100 years and they specialize on data collection for consumer marketing. They survey homes for their watching habits, and I’m sure they also capture data on the Super Bowl.\n\nIf you survey a large number of homes to find out how many people will be there to watch the Super Bowl, they can average that out for the number of homes that watch it to get a reliable person count. And now that the majority of live TV is over streaming, that’s even easier to do.\n\nAt numbers of this scale, outliers don’t really matter. Sure, they might not survey a mansion that hosts 100 people for the game, but there are also tons of people who may watch by themselves or as a couple. So in the end the average is fairly representative."

Steel is stretchy and elastic, and that's a good thing because when the steel is slightly pulled out of shape, it wants to go back into shape like a stretched rubber band. And just like a rubber band, that stretchy force can be used to hold things in place.\n\nBut steel gets deformed if you stretch it too far. You can bend a paper clip a little and it'll snap back, but bend it much further and it holds the new shape. This is bad.\n\nWe know a lot about steel. We know exactly how stretchy it is, at exactly what point that elastic stretchiness turns into permanent bending. We know how much friction it will have against another piece of steel. There are many types of steel and we have this information on all of them.\n\nGiven that information, there are equations where you plug in a bunch of numbers (the carbon content, thickness, diameter, thread size, etc etc etc of the parts used) and it will tell you the ideal amount of torque.\n\nFor critical applications this will then be tested destructively (tighten until the steel bends - note that as too much) and non-destructively (tighten the prescribed amount, stress-test the joint, loosen and re-tighten and stress-test again)."

FDA has very specific guidelines as to what information food producers must put on the labels of their products. These guidelines do not cover alcohol, as the FDA has no regulatory power in that area.\n\nThere are other labeling laws, which alcohol producers must follow, such as listing the percent of pure alcohol in the beverage by volume. These regulations are laid out and enforced by TTB.\n\nThis is currently a matter of some debate, as there are players in the beer industry that strongly support requiring nutrition info labeling requirements on alcohol similar to food and non-alcoholic beverages. Why? Because they want to dispel the notion that hard liquor and wine are \"healthy\" alternatives to beer. Although hard liquor has no carbohydrates, it is very high in calories. When mixed with juice or soda, it can wind up being significantly higher in calories than the average beer. However, the beer industry can't unilaterally start doing this on their own, because there are actually prohibitions on what they are allowed to print on their label in terms of nutrition facts, since alcoholic beverages are considered nutritionally deficient."
