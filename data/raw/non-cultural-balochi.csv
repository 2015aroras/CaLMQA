In the last year 3 acquaintances of mine had heart attack of some sort. The doctor said that smoke was the main reason for all 3 of them.

I read most chainsmokers die of heart attack instead of lung cancer but i don't understand why.","A heart attack is what happens when something (a blood clot, a bit of fat/cholesterol/plaque, etc) blocks one the arteries that supply blood and nutrients to the heart. Smoking impacts this in two ways. First, it causes your blood to thicken and clot more easily, which means clots are more likely to form inside your blood vessels where they're not supposed to. Second, it irritates the lining of your blood vessels, causing them to swell and become less flexible, which makes them narrower and easier to clog. This is also why smoking increases the risk of stroke, which is when the same thing happens to an artery leading to the brain.

It's also worth mentioning that both of those effects are temporary. According to the CDC, the increased risk largely goes away within a year of quitting smoking. However, heart damage from actually having a heart attack is permanent."

Eventually, your device will need to save new information, and it'll look in the address book to see which locations aren't being used.

So, still being kind of awake, the parts of your brain that go dormant during sleep are still active enough to realize that you're paralyzed. Often times though, you're 'asleep' enough to start dreaming.

So what you can get is dreaming while awake but paralyzed. Most people freak out when they realize they're paralyzed, and that can fuel nightmares, so you get people's dreams telling them that there's some kind of monster holding them down to explain their inability to move.

TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited) is one of the premiere chip manufacturing companies in the world but they are hardly the only one.

They are of note because they make everything from common chips used in everything from cars to cellphones to AMDs processors. Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm for example all use TSMC to manufacture their chips.

But Samsung (Korea) and Intel (US) also have chip foundries of that caliber.

TSMCs secret is just that they have large numbers of highly experienced people working for them and have developed very good processes. Samsung and Intel are similar in that regard, but TSMC is special in that the Taiwanese government has in a sense made semiconductor manufacturing the countries primary industry.

Other companies like Texas instruments can also make microchips and have facilities all over the US but can't make chips as complex as Computer microprocessors. Importantly though there's nothing stopping them from investing capital to build such a facility, they just don't want to. (Developing an in house microprocessor to compete with AMD and Intel at this point would require an outrageous investment)

Israel is also another big up and comer in chip manufacturing.

Why TSMC is of note is the Pandemic showed just how vulnerable the US and the West are to losing access to TSMC production. If China for example were to invade Taiwan it could be a really big problem for the economy and availability of these chips.

This is why TSMC is building a Chip Foundry in Texas Arizona right now so chip production can happen domestically in the US."

Hormones are chemical messengers that float around your body and are like snail mail that an organ sends to another organ. For example, when you eat and your stomach gets full, it releases a hormone called ghrelin. When ghrelin reaches your brain, your brain gets the ""stop eating"" message (that's why it takes 15 or so minutes to feel full after a meal—snail mail, relatively speaking). 

It was published a few months ago that a hormone called GDF15 is likely behind morning sickness. One place where GDF15 messages go is to a brain region called the solitary tract, and that brain region controls the gag reflex and vomiting. People produce different levels of GDF15, depending on genetics, diet, and some other factors. Some people have naturally high GDF15 levels and some have low levels. Fetuses produce a lot of GDF15 it turns out, so it was recently found that pregnant mothers who had low levels of GDF15 before becoming pregnant were more likely to experience morning sickness. 

 The growing fetus is releasing chemicals that basically push the ""vomit button"" in mom's brain, but if mom's already used to having that button pushed, they aren't going to be as affected by the fetus. It's like how a seasoned drinker could hammer back a row of shots without, well, vomiting, whereas someone who's never had a drink in their life is going to have a bad time doing the same.

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ahx2mg/eli5_why_do_different_animals_have_different_life/,Why do different animals have different life spans?,چی آ مختلفین سہ دارانی مختلفین زندگی سالاں  ؟,,"Life span is a pretty complicated topic, but we can understand it by using what is known as life history theory.  This is basically the idea that the timing of life events such as how long an animal grows, when and how many times it reproduces, and when it dies are developed through the process of natural selection.  As such, total lifespan for a given species has evolved in a manner similar to any other adaptation, and is related to what will allow that animal to survive, and more importantly, to reproduce in a given environment.

So what are some factors that influence life history and life span?

Life history and average age at death are often linked to body size, and with some exceptions (like bats) larger body size is associated with a longer life span.  For example, mice live a year or maybe two and have what we call a “fast” life history, while a large whale or elephant will live for decades with a “slow” life history.  But why do some animals have a fast life and some a slow life?

Part of this can be explained by looking at extrinsic mortality and how animals have to partition their energetic resources.  An animal can put its energy into either growth, bodily maintenance or reproduction. However energy input is ultimately limited by the environment, so an animal cannot invest into all three infinitely and must therefore partition how much effort it will place into each of these categories. Basically, do you grow a lot, get big, and reproduce only a few offspring? Or do you grow quickly, stay small and reproduce a lot of kids?

One thing that helps decide this is that all animals face extrinsic mortality - basically the likelihood you’ll be taken out by another animal (e.g. predation) or by the environment (e.g., changing seasons, flooding, etc.). If you are faced with high extrinsic mortality, this favors getting in the game reproductively early in life.  In these species you in turn see less investment in growth and bodily maintenance.  They therefore tend to be small, live a short period of time and produce a lot of kids they don’t put a ton of investment into.  Think mice, mayflies and the like.  In contrast, animals with lower extrinsic mortality tend to take time to grow larger (which also further reduces extrinsic mortality), and take a longer time reproducing a smaller number of individuals whom they put a lot of investment into getting to survive their growth into adulthood (think primates, whales and elephants).  

As long-lived, smart primates we often think of our “slow” life history as “better” than a mouse’s short life.  It’s important to recognize that these are simply different, but equally effective, strategies for getting your genes into the next generation.  While a slow life history allows for the development of things like our big brain and tapping on a phone, our mouse friends ultimately have pretty effective strategy in terms of natural selection as well. I’ve really only scratched the surface here, and there are a ton of other factors to look at when it comes to lifespan (e.g., BMR, phylogenetic effects, etc.), but if you are interested there is a lot out there on life history theory."

Physicists and mathematicians have been having trouble modeling exactly what makes two wheeled vehicles stable. Here's one stab at it.

Some things are known to increase stability. The gyroscopic effect of the wheels plays a minor role. As /u/bjujey pointed out below, experiments have shown that removing the gyroscopic effect still makes for a stable bike.

Trail also plays a role. Trail is the measurement of where the steering axis in relation to the contact of the wheel on the ground. Here's a picture for illustration. This is also called the caster effect. Basically the further forward the steering axis is from wheel contact with the ground, the more stable the bike. Track bikes and cyclocross bikes have really short trail to make them more agile. Big stable cruisers have long trails.

Like gyroscopic effect, experiments have removed trail as a variable and these models are also stable. Here is an interview with a scientist who removed both gyroscopic and caster/trail effects in a model bicycle, and it remained stable.

tl;dr: No one really knows what makes a moving bike stable.

Basically a crash is when your system tries to do something very low level like read memory, or display something to the screen and the result is something the computer cannot understand. Since there is no way back, and continuing could do unexpected and irreversible things the system just stops and forces you to restart to get it back into a normal state."

Probably not with any certainty. We're not even sure what consciousness is, other than a complex set of chemical and electrical reactions in the brain.

As far as what happens to it after we die, the only way to know that for sure would be to actually die. And even IF you come back from being dead, you can't be sure that whatever you experienced wasn't a hallucinatory reaction to whatever trauma killed you.

I'm an agnostic atheist, so I generally accept that in all likelihood when we die we just stop existing. The same way that if you shut down a computer and wiped its hard drive, the operating system no longer exists.

If you mean why do severed and seperated bones not grow back, that's because of our genome. We don't have the ""programming"" to grow it back.

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1utlb8/eli5_why_is_gold_so_valuable_and_why_is_it_more/,"Why is gold so valuable? And why is it more valuable than other metals, like silver?","
تلاء ءِ نہاد پرچا گران انت؟ ایدگہ مادن، چش کہ نگرہ ءَ پرچا گران تر انت؟",Please explain LIKE I'M FIVE. Try to limit economic/financial jargon.,"5,000 years ago humans didn't know much about metal, metalworking, geology, or mining. But they did have a sense for fashion.

Most metals exist naturally as rock. The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they don't look very interesting (to a non-geologist). In the world before the Bronze Age, the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold.

Gold can be found as ""nuggets"" or ""dust"". The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some, you're likely to find more. Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers, so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it, and then looking for more - you don't have to mine it.

You can work gold without heat. It is ""malleable"" at room temperature, which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it won't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things.

Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade. It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club, but you don't get much more head-bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood. So other than as jewelry and as decoration, gold has little practical ""use"" to an ancient human.

But it is pretty. Aesthetically gold looks ""good"" next to human skin tones. Why this is so is pretty much a mystery. But it's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development.

Who gets jewelry? Rich people. In the ancient world ""rich"" was defined as ""don't have to farm"". There were only three kinds of people like that: royalty, high priests, and successful generals.

Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it, and it wasn't good for any practical use, and as a metal it would ""stay all in one place"" and didn't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained, it became a way for rich people to display their wealth.

Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity (it's a simple weight/volume calculation). That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold, of a certain purity, was ""worth"" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat, or slaves, or land, or whatever. It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale, a cup, some water, and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me.

5,000 years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals. Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins, even though plutonium is worth, ounce for ounce, vastly more than gold. Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that ancient humans didn't know about - it's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity. And it still looks good next to human skin."

I'm not familiar with this thing you're talking about, but it was popular to have alarm apps that would track your sleep cycles to wake you up when you weren't quite so deep in sleep so it's easier to wake up. This was accomplished by sitting the phone on the mattress and it could tell how much you were moving around. Less moving meant deeper sleep. However, some of them were clever enough to make sure they detected breathing movements (the phone can't tell that apart from other movement, but it would be fairly regular) otherwise, if it were actually on a night stand or something, it would just think you were deep in a REM cycle forever, since the night stand isn't really going to move as you shift in bed."

Longer answer: not in any realistic, safe, or controllable way.

Weather is super complicated and often pretty hard to predict. Imagine if you had a big bowl of water and you kept sloshing it around, meteorology is guessing/analyzing where individual waves will form.

You can effect the weather by large releases of heat or particulates, but both have enormous ecological impacts and are expensive. Also if you mess with the weather in one place you tend to fuck over somewhere else (a la butterfly effect).

So generally its not safe, cheap, or smart, but we could technically do it minorly."

Another one is new devices. An app might’ve been written for the iPhone X but a few years later we’re now on the iPhone 15 with a completely different operating system and features that didn’t exist when the app was written. It needs to know how to recognize and interact with that new OS (and any future updates to the OS) or it could introduce bugs and crash the app.

Finally, and most straight forward, is them adding new stuff to the software. As people use something they provide feedback and the company uses updates to add that feedback into the software."
