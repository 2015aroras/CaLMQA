汽车作为大宗消费品，对老百姓而言，汽车是仅次于住房的最大消费品。购买时不仅会考虑初始购置费用，也会考虑全生命周期使用成本。与传统燃油汽车相比，新能源汽车购车成本相对较高，使用成本相对较低，但使用过程也受充电条件、充电价格等因素影响。

中小城市和农村地区是我国新增汽车需求的重要来源，特别是在出行工具替代升级方面，扩大新能源汽车消费具有较大潜力。

Cars are a bulk consumer product. For ordinary people, cars are the largest consumer product after housing. When purchasing, not only the initial purchase cost will be considered, but the full life cycle cost of use will also be considered. Compared with traditional fuel vehicles, the purchase cost of new energy vehicles is relatively high and the use cost is relatively low. However, the use process is also affected by factors such as charging conditions and charging prices.

There are also some experiences that many people have answered, and I agree with them. There are many differences, such as the use of traditional Chinese characters, eating habits, and the use of banknotes to pay less. In fact, everyone is different. You probably all know it, so I won’t go into details one by one. Here are a few things I am not used to after coming to mainland China: 1) The usage in workplaces is different: for example, when eating in the school cafeteria, the aunt will ask how many taels of rice do you want? I was confused at the time, what does ""two"" mean? How many? How many taels do I need to be considered normal? Seeing someone say two liang or one liang, I would say one liang, and the rice I got was probably half a bowl. In Taiwan, there is no such thing as ""a few taels of rice"", it means ""a bowl"" (a full bowl), or ""half a bowl""; there is also a unit of weight, in mainland China, at first I heard it was a few kilograms, "" ""I'm 110 pounds"" and ""I'm 120 pounds"" were really hard to react to. Later I found out that in mainland China, 110 pounds is actually ""55 kg"". Just divide it by 2, but in Taiwan, one pound is 600 grams. Ahhhhh, no wonder I haven't been able to react! ! ! 2) Different habits of getting on and off the bus: When I was in the school dormitory, I often had to take the bus (yes, I know it’s called a bus in China) to and from school. When I first got on the bus and looked around, I didn’t see a bus bell or a line that could be pulled. , and then I discovered that mainland buses stop at every stop, so you don’t need to wave when waiting for the bus! ! This is not the case in Taiwan. When waiting for a bus at a bus stop, if the bus you want to take comes, you must wave, otherwise the driver will probably think that no one wants to get on the bus and drive away! ! ! No lie! Will drive away directly! When you get off the bus, you have to press the bell to tell the driver that someone is getting off, so the driver will pull over and stop. Otherwise, he will think that no one is getting off and drive all the way! ! !

Chinese,Zhihu,Author,https://www.zhihu.com/question/290971512,如何评价如懿传中周迅的演技？,How do you evaluate Zhou Xun's acting skills in Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace?,一部片子的好坏，有天时地利人和诸多因素，很多喜欢周迅的人实在是没有必要因为如懿传负面评论较多，就摆出一副“就是好，就是好，就是好啊就是好”的架势。梁朝伟张曼玉巩俐都有荒腔走板的时候，周迅被差评真的不是什么难以接受的事。周迅是天赋最好那一档的演员，是一个自身气质对角色有重大加成的演员，但不是一个全面的演员。她塑造得最出色的角色，几乎都有一个相同的特征，就是一半是周迅本人，一半是角色。这种用生命体验演戏的缺陷就是，遇到和自身反差过大的角色，反而不能用更为专业的技巧弥补上去。如懿传中的周迅显然不尽如人意。演技好最直白的标准，就是不出戏，当一个演员让大部分人的关注点都跑偏到剧情无关的元素上时，这就是失败。如懿传最大限度暴露了周迅台词的问题，第一，京派口音不自然；第二，气息和重音缺乏古味儿；第三，例如海兰偷炭的戏，由于嗓音条件的限制，过于低沉，和剧情本身的张力有撕裂。历史剧的台词非常需要话剧功底，因为历史剧的台词需要戏剧感，节奏和发声方式都要更为用力。周迅有些发音太短促，重音不清晰，其他角色下可能会天然带着一种小女孩的天真感，但如懿这个角色显然不适合，不仅仅是音色的问题。形态和表情目前为止算是正常发挥，但由于如懿原著问题很多，如懿个性上缺乏光芒，目前为止剧本改编也没有解决好，始终缺乏记忆点，缺乏个性魅力，被限制在一个对君王之爱有不切实际幻想的可怜女性中，很老套也很赶客，这不能算是周迅的问题，但再牛的演技也很难突破剧本本身的硬伤。希望周迅借这部戏的争议认真规划一下自己接下来的演员之路，由于个人风格太突出，她的转型可能会比别人更为艰难。9-28更一下。看到五十多集实在看不下去了。如果有如懿传的粉丝路过，希望可以帮我解答一个疑问：如果如懿的设定是一个清高、追求真爱、追求自由、且聪慧的女性，这样一个女性真爱居然是个猥琐薄情还有暴力倾向的男人，逻辑在何处?感情的立足点究竟在哪儿？我不认为一句轻飘飘的青梅竹马能解释这么扭曲的情感，这样一个女性真的聪慧么？难道所谓婚姻围城就是一个没有现实感的女人最后求仁得仁么？何必让周迅来呢？,"The quality of a film depends on the right time, place, and many factors. Many people who like Zhou Xun really don’t need to pretend that “it’s just good, it’s just good, it’s just good, it’s just good” just because there are many negative comments about Ruyi’s Royal Love in the Palace ” posture. When Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Gong Li all have ridiculous voices and go out of their way, it's really not hard to accept that Zhou Xun got bad reviews. Zhou Xun is an actor with the most talent. He is an actor whose temperament greatly adds to the role, but he is not a comprehensive actor. The most outstanding characters she has created almost all have the same characteristic, that is, they are half Zhou Xun himself and half the character. The shortcoming of this kind of acting based on life experience is that when you encounter a character that is too different from yourself, you cannot use more professional skills to make up for it. Zhou Xun in Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace is obviously unsatisfactory. The most straightforward criterion for good acting is not to make a scene. When an actor makes most people's attention divert to elements that have nothing to do with the plot, this is a failure. Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace exposes the problems of Zhou Xun's lines to the greatest extent. First, the Beijing accent is unnatural; second, the breath and accent lack the ancient flavor; third, for example, the scene where Hailan steals charcoal is too deep due to the limitations of her voice. It is torn apart from the tension of the plot itself. The lines in historical dramas require drama skills very much, because the lines in historical dramas require a sense of drama, and the rhythm and vocalization method need to be more vigorous. Some of Zhou Xun's pronunciations are too short and the accents are not clear. In other roles, he may naturally have a sense of innocence of a little girl, but the role of Ruyi is obviously not suitable. It is not just a matter of timbre. The form and expression are normal so far, but due to the many problems in Ruyi's original work, Ruyi's personality lacks brilliance, and the script adaptation has not been solved so far. It always lacks memory points, lacks personality charm, and is limited to a love for the king. The poor women with unrealistic fantasies are very clichéd and push away customers. This cannot be regarded as Zhou Xun's problem, but no matter how good his acting skills are, it is difficult to break through the shortcomings of the script itself. I hope Zhou Xun will take advantage of the controversy of this drama to seriously plan her future career as an actress. Because her personal style is so prominent, her transformation may be more difficult than others. Updated on 9-28. After watching more than 50 episodes, I really can’t stand it anymore. If there are fans of Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace passing by, I hope you can help me answer a question: If Ruyi's setting is a noble, pursuing true love, pursuing freedom, and intelligent woman, such a female true love is actually a wretched, heartless and violent person. Man, where is the logic? Where is the foothold of emotion? I don’t think a simple childhood sweetheart can explain such twisted emotions. Is such a woman really smart? Could it be that the so-called marriage siege means that a woman who has no sense of reality finally seeks mercy and gets mercy? Why let Zhou Xun come?",FALSE,,,

Chinese,Zhihu,Author,https://www.zhihu.com/question/649450406,女子在一公厕废纸篓里救出被弃男婴，已送往医院救治，弃婴者将受到什么惩罚？,A woman rescued an abandoned baby boy from a public toilet wastebasket and sent him to the hospital for treatment. What will be the punishment for the abandoned baby?,相应的，在民法典也特意提出来， 禁止溺婴、 弃婴和其他残害婴儿的行为。从生活中来看，一般溺婴大多是针对女婴，这是传统思想作祟。而弃婴和其他的行为则大多是对于有病或者是无力抚养的情况。我们经常看到新闻会有福利院门口的婴儿，或者说家门口出现神秘的来客。当然不可能每个人都是哈利波特这种情况，绝大多数弃婴的行为都是常理所不能接受的。之前有篇报道叫做《法律轻判了溺婴母亲吗？》，里面是这样写的：2005年7月，从江西去广东打工的周模英因其小女儿自月初起生病，多次求治未愈。在此期间，周模英又觉得丈夫对自己和生病的小女儿漠不关心，由此产生怨恨情绪，于7月20日凌晨3时许，因小女儿发高烧苦哭闹不止，周遂在其租住的天河区车陂村江夏大街的大院里，把小女儿投进河涌里，造成溺水死亡。2005年，这则新闻曾经在广东轰动一时，人们并不完全是对这位母亲的狠心感到惊讶和气愤，更因为一个叫杨斌的检察官那份请求法官对周模英轻判的公诉书。2005年12月7日，周模英案在广州中级法院开庭，在当庭发表的公诉词里，杨斌如此分析周模英的作案动机：“生活的操劳，丈夫的冷漠，疾病的困扰，经济的重压，再加上远离家乡亲人，缺少应有的沟通，孤独、压抑、郁闷的情绪无法发泄，再加上自身的愚昧，这一切促使了周模英选择了这样一种冲动愚蠢的行为。”她甚至如此为周陈情：“周模英的遭遇，固然是她个人的悲剧，但何尝又不是这个社会、这个时代的悲剧？周模英站在法庭上接受审判，固然是法律的胜利，但是我们不能漠视隐藏在背后的社会原因和背景，我们不能忘记站在她身后的那些挣扎在社会底层，为生存而苦苦呻吟的人们，他们的苦难和命运。这也是法律应有的良知。”溺婴母亲轻判11年-搜狐新闻可以看到，在法律上处理这样的犯罪也比较简单。一般对于父母出于无力抚养等非特别恶劣主观动机而将亲生婴儿杀害的溺婴行为会被认为是“情节较轻”的行为。 （当然如果有力抚养，就是撂挑子不干了，显然是充满恶意的啊）相较来说，对比一般的普通故意杀人罪，还是判的较轻的。不过在我国台湾地区仍在施行的刑法中，生母杀婴这个罪名，是有单独适用的法律条文的，罪行最低可以到六个月。在这里虽然前面说了这么多，但我依然认为从各种角度说，这都不是法律能够解决的问题，或者说单纯法律解决不了的问题。为什么这么说呢，至少我们很容易想到，溺婴的孩童是没有办法表达出他的愤怒的。而一方面，积极选择将这些小孩陷入绝境的又是他们的至亲。之所以会走到这一步，一方面我们依然要坚决去打击重男轻女的这种现象，因为可以说很多溺婴事件的受害者都是女童。另一方面，对于这种特殊情况的儿童，是不是可能会有相应的一个指引，也是需要再去考虑的问题。能够对自己的至亲骨肉下手，虽然一万种理由可以说新生儿是感情不深如何如何。但我们不可能说谁都是冷冰冰能三下五除二就动手的，这多少反应了一丝丝纠结。不难发现，正是这样的纠结，让我们对待这个事件会有多元化的看法。我们大多数人都是善良的，会因为这样的纠结去产生近乎于矛盾的看法。一方面会坚定的认为杀人是不对的，因为生命是可贵的。但同时又会为生活实际苦难而触动。我们经常会去说，包括这也是很多家长所担心的，能够照顾一时，不能照顾一世。待家人走后这些长不大的孩子又会如何生活，其实是一个很大的社会问题。如果一定说有什么能够解决的话，我希望是国家这个共同的大家长能够更直接的来处理这样一个问题，毕竟我坚定的认为冷冰冰的法律条文并不是最优解。我们在这里并不是说秉持着所谓的圣母之心去批判什么东西，而是说应该共同去关注怎样把这样一个问题去解决。包括说能不能恢复说强制产检婚检都是可以考虑的。我一直认为，能够把身体有残疾的孩子抚养长大的家庭，父母亲都是伟大的，因为把这个生命带到了这个世界上，还尽力去抚养他长大。毕竟我们都知道，生命是可贵的。为了生活而让他们失去生活，不是最好的办法。而我们都知道，杀人是不对的。,"Correspondingly, the Civil Code also specifically prohibits infant drowning, abandonment and other acts of mutilating infants. Judging from daily life, infanticide is mostly targeted at female infants. This is caused by traditional thinking. Abandoning babies and other behaviors are mostly for those who are sick or unable to raise them. We often see in the news a baby at the door of an orphanage, or a mysterious visitor at the door of our home. Of course, it is impossible for everyone to be in Harry Potter's situation. The behavior of most abandoned babies is unacceptable to common sense. There was a previous report called ""Does the law lightly sentence mothers who drown their babies?"" "", which reads: In July 2005, Zhou Moying, who went to work in Guangdong from Jiangxi, had her little daughter fall ill since the beginning of the month and sought medical treatment many times. During this period, Zhou Moying felt that her husband was indifferent to her and her sick little daughter, which led to resentment. At about 3 a.m. on July 20, because her little daughter had a high fever and was crying in pain, Zhou Sui went to her rented apartment. In the courtyard of Jiangxia Street, Chebei Village, Tianhe District, he threw his little daughter into the river, causing her to drown. In 2005, this news caused a sensation in Guangdong. People were not entirely surprised and angry at the mother's cruelty, but also because of the indictment written by a prosecutor named Yang Bin asking the judge to give Zhou Moying a lighter sentence. On December 7, 2005, Zhou Moying's case was heard in the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court. In the public prosecution speech delivered in court, Yang Bin analyzed Zhou Moying's motive for committing the crime: ""The hard work of life, the indifference of her husband, the troubles of illness, and the heavy financial pressure. Coupled with the fact that she is far away from her family and relatives, lacks proper communication, and cannot vent her loneliness, depression, and depression, as well as her own ignorance, all this prompted Zhou Moying to choose such an impulsive and stupid behavior. ""She even said this. Zhou Chenqing: ""What happened to Zhou Moying is certainly her personal tragedy, but how can it not be the tragedy of this society and this era? It is certainly a victory for the law for Zhou Moying to stand in court and accept the trial, but we cannot ignore the hidden truth behind it."" Due to social reasons and background, we cannot forget the suffering and fate of those people who are struggling at the bottom of society and struggling for survival behind her. This is also the conscience that the law should have. ""The mother who drowned her baby was given a light sentence of 11 years. -Sohu News You can see that it is relatively simple to deal with such crimes legally. Generally, the act of infanticide, in which parents kill their biological babies due to non-evil subjective motives such as inability to raise them, is considered a ""minor"" act. (Of course, if he is unable to raise him, he will give up the job, which is obviously full of malice.) Comparatively speaking, compared with ordinary intentional homicide, the sentence is still lighter. However, in the criminal law still in force in Taiwan, the crime of maternal infanticide has separate applicable legal provisions, and the minimum crime can be up to six months. Although I have said so much before, I still think that from various perspectives, this is not a problem that can be solved by law, or a problem that cannot be solved by law alone. Why do we say this? At least it is easy for us to think that a child who drowns his baby cannot express his anger. On the one hand, it is their relatives who actively choose to put these children into desperate situations. The reason why we have reached this point is that on the one hand, we still have to resolutely crack down on the phenomenon of favoring boys over girls, because it can be said that many victims of infant drowning incidents are girls. On the other hand, whether there may be corresponding guidelines for children in this special situation is another issue that needs to be considered. Being able to attack one's own flesh and blood, even though there are ten thousand reasons to say that newborns are not emotionally affectionate. But we can't say that everyone is Leng Bingbing who can do it three times, five times, five times and two times. This reflects a little bit of entanglement. It is not difficult to find that it is this kind of entanglement that allows us to have diversified views on this event. Most of us are kind-hearted, and we will have almost contradictory views because of such entanglements. On the one hand, they firmly believe that killing is wrong because life is precious. But at the same time, he is touched by the actual hardships of life. We often say, and this is what many parents worry about, that they can take care of them for a while, but not for the rest of their lives. How these young children will live after their families leave is actually a big social problem. If there is anything that can be solved, I hope that the country, as the common owner, can deal with such a problem more directly. After all, I firmly believe that cold legal provisions are not the optimal solution. We are not here to criticize anything with the so-called Holy Mother's heart, but to say that we should jointly pay attention to how to solve such a problem. Including whether it can be restored and mandatory prenatal and premarital examinations are all things that can be considered. I have always believed that in a family that can raise a child with a physical disability, the parents are great because they brought this life into this world and tried their best to raise him. After all, we all know that life is precious. Letting them lose their lives for the sake of living is not the best solution. And we all know that killing is wrong.",FALSE,,,

近日，有网友发现，央视还在继续封杀梅西。

事情是这样的，北京时间4月11日18：35分，央视体育频道（CCTV5）如期播出欧冠特别节目《冠军欧洲》。

《冠军欧洲》显示播出了头天晚上欧冠两场比赛的集锦和集锦，然后又播出了“观察家”板块，紧接着推出最新的“城记”特别栏目。

恰巧，当天晚上介绍的城市为巴塞罗那。

众所周知，一提到巴塞罗那这座西班牙俱乐部，大部分球迷第一时间想到的自然是里奥.梅西，毕竟梅西几乎可以说是巴塞罗那的旗帜。

然而令人没有想到的是，节目从头到尾几乎提到了曾在巴塞罗那足球队效力的十几名球星名字，唯独不见梅西。

最令人深刻的，当属在视频画面当中，央视刻意避开所有与梅西相关的镜头。

甚至就连梅西与内马尔以及苏亚雷斯的MSN著名合照，央视也有意将梅西的镜头避开，直接变成了SN合照。

值得一提的是，在《冠军欧洲》播放结束后，央视的这一举动迅速在网上引起了许多球迷的热议。

支持梅西的球迷认为：简直离谱至极，（《冠军欧洲》）作为一档公开节目，制作刊载发布的视频，公然""篡改""队史。一部巴萨传，半部梅西史，梅西的名字和巴塞罗那，和这座俱乐部息息相关，作为队史第一人，诺坎普的过往，梅西是所有真正巴萨球迷心里不可磨灭的存在，竟然在一档官方发布的节目中删除所有镜头和画面，闭口不提。

当然，也有不少球迷表示永远支持央视做出的决定。

此外，也有网友提到，此前梅西被《天下足球》删除的片头镜头，在后来的节目中，央视又给补回去了。

也正因为此，这次央视5台的《冠军欧洲》（再次将梅西的镜头）才会引出如此大的争议。

当然，央视到底是失误所至，还是其他原因，咱们不得而知。

不过在大是大非面前，相信大部分球迷还是会和央视站在一起。","CCTV is still suspected of banning Messi, and its flagship program intentionally deletes footage of Messi. What is the story behind this?
Recently, some netizens discovered that CCTV continues to block Messi.

""Champions Europe"" showed and broadcast the highlights and highlights of the two Champions League games the night before, and then broadcast the ""Observer"" section, followed by the launch of the latest ""City Chronicles"" special column.

However, what was unexpected was that the program almost mentioned the names of more than a dozen stars who had played for the Barcelona football team from beginning to end, except Messi.

The most impressive thing is that in the video footage, CCTV deliberately avoided all shots related to Messi.

Even in the famous MSN photo of Messi, Neymar and Suarez, CCTV deliberately avoided the lens of Messi and directly turned it into an SN photo.

我初中之前住在现在的法华镇路附近，记忆里那时候每天晚上出了小区的门就很热闹，沿街商铺很多，初中的时候搬到了现在的威宁路附近，晚上也还是很热闹的，特别是沿街商铺很多，晚上如果沿着路边走，有吃有喝有逛。大学的时候我家搬到了联洋一代，等我15年毕业回国，为了上班近，我自己住在了张江，一开始以为是我们住的地方太偏远了，所以一到晚上八九点钟，除了急匆匆的上下班赶地铁的人，整个街区都变得很冷清，特别是晚上九点以后。联洋附近的嘉里中心，大拇指广场这些就变得冷冷清清，张江就一个长泰还像点样子，也就是到八点就冷清了，别的商场都快半死不活的了。

现在慢慢发现，不光是因为我家住的远了，整个上海的夜晚都变得很冷清，经常过了八点半，商场就一副开始准备打样的感觉，饭店慢慢都开在了商场里，晚上想吃点宵夜，也越来越没得选，就剩下了一些火锅烧烤龙虾小吃，即使去新天地静安寺或者人广，也是八点就开始渐渐冷清，前些年整治破墙开店，沿街的店铺也越来越少。

前些日子跟同学聚会，大家都在感慨现在上海越来越没有夜生活了，不知道是我们这些90后年纪大了还是真的上海越来越冷清了。不知道其他城市是不是也这样。","Why is there less and less nightlife in Shanghai now, and it is becoming more and more deserted at night?",前天买鸭头，跟老板比较熟嘛，就闲聊了一会，得到俩消息1.2023年春节以后，很多离开上海的人，就再也没回来。这再过去十多年都是极为罕见的。2.周围大部分商铺，看着生意还不错的，营业额减去房租水电，剩下的连员工工资都不够。好一点的，一家人打工经营，一合计相当于一家人投资了几十上百万的给全家人找了个班上；差一点的，有一家挺大的烧烤店的老板还要自己跑出去偷偷打工补贴店里。心情挺复杂的，我记得十年以前，这种小店按照正常人流量赚个三五十万不成问题，如今就挣扎在生死线上。要知道，中国餐饮店一年内倒闭的概率是7成，这些已经算是佼佼者了。地铁口的一个小铺面，15个平方，月租金是一万六，加上水电，老板平均每天醒来就欠房东600块，但是鸭头一天只能卖1000多，店里还雇俩员工。造成这种局面的原因有很多，我是个宏观分析师，但今天不谈宏观因素，谈些微观的。压垮他们的，毫无疑问是房租，但是房租是谁抬高的？鸭头行业来说，就是商场里诸多的“X某鸭”。这类上市企业有丰富的融资工具，甚至还能通过加盟授权的方式二次加杠杆（加盟商相当于给品牌方无息无本贷款开店），企业为了抢占市场，可以不惜重金不计盈亏疯狂的开店，把鸭头店的成本抬高到个体户无法承受的高度，抢占市场。资本运作对传统家庭作坊的优势，有时候甚至都不在于生产效率和标准化之类。两者单单在融资市场上的地位就是不对等的，资本可以轻而易举的用银行的钱，要个体户的命。个体户被干掉之后，大家能去消费的场所只有商场里的x某鸭，由于每一份鸭头的售价中租金成本占一半，所以事实上所有的消费者都在付租金税。租金税付给了谁？我想是商场业主。——商场业主向谁付费？我猜是还银行贷款——银行钱给了谁？我猜是开发商。——开发商的钱给了谁？我猜是卖地的吧——卖地的钱去了哪里？造桥修路上项目。这个循环没啥问题，按道理来讲，钱取之于民用之于民。造桥修路上项目最终会使得社会整体生产物流成本降低，进而促进生产。但是，问题在于。贷款是有油水的，卖地也是有油水的，修桥造路上项目也是有油水的。循环的实际过程中，分配是严重不均衡的。世界的本质，是羊去找狐狸借钱，给狼花。回到鸭头店，我觉得这家很好吃的店也开不了太久了。外卖平台抽水可怕，做抖音推广费极高还不保证效果。他早上6店就要去进货，店要开到晚上11店，一家三口人齐上阵，全年无休。赚钱还好，不赚钱坚持下去就很难了。而且，看不到希望。,"I bought duck heads the day before yesterday. I am familiar with the boss, so I chatted for a while and got two pieces of news: 1. After the Spring Festival in 2023, many people who left Shanghai never came back. This was extremely rare in the past ten years or so. 2. Most of the surrounding shops seem to be doing pretty well. After deducting the rent, water and electricity from the turnover, the rest is not even enough for employee wages. A good one is that a family works and runs the business, and the total investment is equivalent to the family investing tens or millions to find a class for the whole family; a worse one is that the owner of a large barbecue restaurant has to run out by himself Working secretly to subsidize the store. I feel quite complicated. I remember that ten years ago, a small shop like this would have no problem making three to five million yuan based on normal traffic, but now it is struggling on the line of life and death. You know, the probability of a Chinese restaurant going bankrupt within a year is 70%. These are already the best. A small shop at the subway entrance is 15 square meters, and the monthly rent is 16,000 yuan. Including water and electricity, the boss owes the landlord an average of 600 yuan every day when he wakes up, but he can only sell more than 1,000 duck heads a day, and the store still employs two employees. There are many reasons for this situation. I am a macro analyst, but today I will not talk about macro factors, but some micro ones. What crushes them is undoubtedly the rent, but who raises the rent? As far as the duck head industry is concerned, there are many ""X ducks"" in shopping malls. Such listed companies have a wealth of financing tools, and can even increase leverage twice through franchise authorization (franchisees are equivalent to giving brand owners interest-free and capital-free loans to open stores). In order to seize the market, companies can spend a lot of money regardless of profits and losses. Open a store, raise the cost of duck head restaurant to a height that is unbearable for individual entrepreneurs, and seize the market. The advantages of capital operation over traditional family workshops sometimes do not even lie in production efficiency and standardization. The status of the two in the financing market alone is unequal. Capital can easily use bank money to kill self-employed individuals. After the self-employed are eliminated, the only place where everyone can go to consume is duck in the mall. Since the rental cost accounts for half of the selling price of each duck head, in fact all consumers are paying rent tax. Who is the rental tax paid to? I think it's the mall owner. ——Who does the mall owner pay? I guess it's to repay the bank loan - who did the bank money go to? I'm guessing it's the developer. ——Who does the developer’s money go to? I guess it's the person who sold the land - where did the money from selling the land go? Bridge construction and road construction projects. There is nothing wrong with this cycle. Logically speaking, money is taken from the people and used for the people. Bridge construction and road construction projects will eventually reduce the overall production and logistics costs of society, thereby promoting production. But here's the thing. Loans are risky, selling land is risky, and building bridges and roads is risky. In the actual process of the cycle, the distribution is seriously uneven. The essence of the world is that sheep go to foxes to borrow money and give flowers to wolves. Back at Duck Head Restaurant, I felt that this delicious restaurant wouldn’t be open for long. The takeaway platforms are terrible, and the cost of promoting Douyin is extremely high and the results are not guaranteed. He would go to the store at 6 a.m. to stock up, and the store would be open until 11 p.m., with a family of three working together, all year round.

问题补充：因为我觉得背文言文会让我养成经常无意识地、一字不差地去背东西的坏习惯，感觉就是在背一堆「随机组成的汉字一样」不知道该怎么办才好。

并且古文以及古文承载的思想，在1850年到1930年这段时间里，不仅没能抵御、改变那段悲惨的历史，而且古文本身反倒被新时代的白话文全面取代了。","Now that classical Chinese has been completely replaced by vernacular, what is the significance of requiring students to memorize classical Chinese?
Question added: Because I feel that memorizing classical Chinese will make me develop the bad habit of memorizing things word for word unconsciously. It feels like I am memorizing a bunch of ""randomly composed Chinese characters"" and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, ancient Chinese prose and the ideas it carries, from 1850 to 1930, not only failed to resist or change that tragic history, but the ancient Chinese prose itself was completely replaced by the vernacular Chinese of the new era.","不是，你背文言文真的只是机械地背，一点文章的意思都不去理解啊？
