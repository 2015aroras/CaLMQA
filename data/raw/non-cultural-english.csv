The diesel and hybrid pair seem like a great idea in theory.,"A lot of people see hybrids and plug in hybrids as a great middle ground between ICE and EV, so why not make a diesel hybrid. They can be used in a variety of vehicles, and can reduce the nox and particulate emissions diesels are known for. So why isn't there a modern diesel hybrid being produced, at least as a passenger car?","I work at a car company, and getting clean diesel emissions is complicated. Between the sensors, computers, def system, and heat management, small car diesel engines are significantly more complex than standard turbocharged gas engines, which are almost as efficient and way cheaper to make. Combine that with the battery and other electric systems, and a hybrid diesel would be a nightmare to engineer and manufacture.

Diesels have advantages for heavy duty trucks and towing, so we still make plenty of them, but there really isn't a market for a more expensive hybrid that would likely also break down more often.",Engineering,,Yes,,162,30,,78

Objects of all sizes from ants to galaxies are made of the same tiny particles like molecules, atoms, electrons and quarks. they follow the same rules, and interact through the same waves like microwaves, visible light, and X-rays.

However physics *appears* to work differently when we focus on a certain scale and try to tell a simple story. For example a basketball bouncing on the floor, or a chemical reaction, or a rocket taking off, or a star exploding into a supernova. For each of these, going back to the behavior of elementary particles to try and piece the whole story together would be way too complicated. But at each scale, we've often been able to come up with a few simpler rules that do the job. We don't care about what happens to atoms in the basketball or molecules in a glass of water, so we can make the story much simpler.

the radius is the length of a line from the circles edge to the center. the circles edge is where all 3 points of the triangle are (meaning of inscribed) so draw a line from 2 of the triangle points to the center. you now have an Isosceles triangle with sides r,r, and x. you know the angles as well, you cut 2 60 degree angles in half, ao thats 30, 30, and whatever adds to make 180 (120). now you can use law of sins to find x.

alternativly, you can further cut the isoscelese trianglemin to 2 right triangles with hypotenuse r, angles 60 30 90, one side x/2, and the other unknown. for a 30 60 90 triangle, the sides are hypotenuse 2x, side opposite 30 x, other side x√3, so you now know that the triangle you just found has sides r, r/2, and x/2=r√3/2. you couks find the area of this triangle and multiply by 6, or you now know x is r√3, and the triangle height is 3r/2 (r/2+r),

I read most chainsmokers die of heart attack instead of lung cancer but i don't understand why.","A heart attack is what happens when something (a blood clot, a bit of fat/cholesterol/plaque, etc) blocks one the arteries that supply blood and nutrients to the heart. Smoking impacts this in two ways. First, it causes your blood to thicken and clot more easily, which means clots are more likely to form inside your blood vessels where they're not supposed to. Second, it irritates the lining of your blood vessels, causing them to swell and become less flexible, which makes them narrower and easier to clog. This is also why smoking increases the risk of stroke, which is when the same thing happens to an artery leading to the brain.

It's also worth mentioning that both of those effects are temporary. According to the CDC, the increased risk largely goes away within a year of quitting smoking. However, heart damage from actually having a heart attack is permanent.",Biology,,,,37,9,,

",,"Neuroscience PhD here. None of it actually works like that.

There are two parts to this. One is about dopamine and one is about reward / motivation in general.

About dopamine: There is a lot of bad pop-neuroscience out there, but the idea that neurotransmitters have specific functions is one of the most widespread, because it makes such intuitive sense, even though it's mostly wrong. The best I can explain it is to say that neurotransmitters do not have specific cognitive functions, brain circuits do. Dopamine is used for all kinds of different things in different brain circuits, many of which have nothing to do with reward (e.g. tuberoinfundibular pathway which controls lactation, and nigrostriatal pathway which modulates movement initiation, see also Parkinsons). Furthermore, the specific reward-associated brain circuits that DO involve dopamine (mesolimbic pathway) also involve a ton of other neurotransmitters. And, to top it all off, dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway does not exclusively happen after positive events. It can happen after negative events as well.

So, to summarize, dopamine is not very specifically associated with reward and motivation, and the notion that dopamine release = pleasure is absolutely false. The majority of addictive drugs don't even directly affect dopamine neurotransmission.

The second part is about neuroscience's level of understanding of reward and motivation. To be blunt, it's not very good. This is my job, I do research on the neural activity underlying goal directed behavior and drug addiction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. And I can tell you that our understanding of how ANY of this stuff works is still extremely primitive. At this point, a lot of what we know basically comes down to ""we know area X is involved in function Y"" and then haggling over the exact nature of what it is or isn't involved in. But any complex function of the brain (and motivation / reward is one of the most complex there is) has many different brain areas involved, and disentangling exactly HOW they're all involved is hard. We definitely do not know in any real sense how any of it actually WORKS. We're working on it, to be sure! But technology is a huge limiting factor.

A lot of what we currently know stems from research techniques that give us only very vague ideas of what is going on in each part of the brain. Imagine the brain is a football stadium and neurons are people. If the only information you had was from a handful of microphones attached to the stadium roof (analogous to fMRI), you might be able to figure out some basic patterns (games usually last X hours, usually there are different areas of the stadium that get excited at opposing times), but learning the rules of the game would be IMPOSSIBLE. Then there's other methods (electrical recordings from implanted electrodes) that might let you pick up the words of one or two people, but only for a short length of time, plus you don't know the language, and many of the people in the stadium speak different languages, and they may not even be talking about the game at the time you are listening. And you can't really pick who it is you'll be listening to. Also when you do this it kills some of the people in the stadium, so you don't usually do it in real football stadiums.

There are other methods, but hopefully this gets across the point that we can't just say ""here's what we need to find out, let's go do the experiment and find out the answer!""

Two more points... First, about the limitations of reinforcement: Conditioning in its various forms is not super-powerful. It doesn't always work. In fact, many types of conditioning you may have read about only work under specific circumstances.

Second, about the complexity of emotions: I've noticed that the idea that neurotransmitters are linked to specific emotions tends to carry with it the assumption that emotions are very basic, simple things. This could not be further from the truth. Emotions represent the final output of ludicrously complex and poorly understood brain systems working in the background of your mind, every waking second of your life, to analyze what's going on around you, what has recently happened and likely soon will happen, the possible actions you might take and what they could cause, the possible actions and intentions of the people around you, and more. All the time, those parts of your brain are analyzing that information and boiling it down to what you experience as feelings about particularly situations, people, events, choices, and so on. Nothing to do with emotions is ever simple or basic, and certainly cannot be understood in terms of a single brain area or neurochemical.",Biology,,,,266,44,,

So, still being kind of awake, the parts of your brain that go dormant during sleep are still active enough to realize that you're paralyzed. Often times though, you're 'asleep' enough to start dreaming.

So what you can get is dreaming while awake but paralyzed.

TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited) is one of the premiere chip manufacturing companies in the world but they are hardly the only one.

They are of note because they make everything from common chips used in everything from cars to cellphones to AMDs processors. Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm for example all use TSMC to manufacture their chips.

But Samsung (Korea) and Intel (US) also have chip foundries of that caliber.

TSMCs secret is just that they have large numbers of highly experienced people working for them and have developed very good processes. Samsung and Intel are similar in that regard, but TSMC is special in that the Taiwanese government has in a sense made semiconductor manufacturing the countries primary industry.

Other companies like Texas instruments can also make microchips and have facilities all over the US but can't make chips as complex as Computer microprocessors. Importantly though there's nothing stopping them from investing capital to build such a facility, they just don't want to. (Developing an in house microprocessor to compete with AMD and Intel at this point would require an outrageous investment)

Israel is also another big up and comer in chip manufacturing.

Why TSMC is of note is the Pandemic showed just how vulnerable the US and the West are to losing access to TSMC production. If China for example were to invade Taiwan it could be a really big problem for the economy and availability of these chips.

Why do many only have it in the 1st trimester but some experience their whole pregnancy?,,"The short version is: the developing fetus makes hormones that make mom feel sick (if mom's body isn't used to the hormone). 

Hormones are chemical messengers that float around your body and are like snail mail that an organ sends to another organ. For example, when you eat and your stomach gets full, it releases a hormone called ghrelin. When ghrelin reaches your brain, your brain gets the ""stop eating"" message (that's why it takes 15 or so minutes to feel full after a meal—snail mail, relatively speaking). 

It was published a few months ago that a hormone called GDF15 is likely behind morning sickness. One place where GDF15 messages go is to a brain region called the solitary tract, and that brain region controls the gag reflex and vomiting. People produce different levels of GDF15, depending on genetics, diet, and some other factors. Some people have naturally high GDF15 levels and some have low levels. Fetuses produce a lot of GDF15 it turns out, so it was recently found that pregnant mothers who had low levels of GDF15 before becoming pregnant were more likely to experience morning sickness. 

 The growing fetus is releasing chemicals that basically push the ""vomit button"" in mom's brain, but if mom's already used to having that button pushed, they aren't going to be as affected by the fetus. It's like how a seasoned drinker could hammer back a row of shots without, well, vomiting, whereas someone who's never had a drink in their life is going to have a bad time doing the same.

This is basically the idea that the timing of life events such as how long an animal grows, when and how many times it reproduces, and when it dies are developed through the process of natural selection.  As such, total lifespan for a given species has evolved in a manner similar to any other adaptation, and is related to what will allow that animal to survive, and more importantly, to reproduce in a given environment.

So what are some factors that influence life history and life span?

Life history and average age at death are often linked to body size, and with some exceptions (like bats) larger body size is associated with a longer life span.  For example, mice live a year or maybe two and have what we call a “fast” life history, while a large whale or elephant will live for decades with a “slow” life history.  But why do some animals have a fast life and some a slow life?

Part of this can be explained by looking at extrinsic mortality and how animals have to partition their energetic resources.  An animal can put its energy into either growth, bodily maintenance or reproduction. However energy input is ultimately limited by the environment, so an animal cannot invest into all three infinitely and must therefore partition how much effort it will place into each of these categories. Basically, do you grow a lot, get big, and reproduce only a few offspring? Or do you grow quickly, stay small and reproduce a lot of kids?

One thing that helps decide this is that all animals face extrinsic mortality - basically the likelihood you’ll be taken out by another animal (e.g. predation) or by the environment (e.g., changing seasons, flooding, etc.). If you are faced with high extrinsic mortality, this favors getting in the game reproductively early in life.  In these species you in turn see less investment in growth and bodily maintenance.  They therefore tend to be small, live a short period of time and produce a lot of kids they don’t put a ton of investment into.  Think mice, mayflies and the like.  In contrast, animals with lower extrinsic mortality tend to take time to grow larger (which also further reduces extrinsic mortality), and take a longer time reproducing a smaller number of individuals whom they put a lot of investment into getting to survive their growth into adulthood (think primates, whales and elephants).  

As long-lived, smart primates we often think of our “slow” life history as “better” than a mouse’s short life.  It’s important to recognize that these are simply different, but equally effective, strategies for getting your genes into the next generation.  While a slow life history allows for the development of things like our big brain and tapping on a phone, our mouse friends ultimately have pretty effective strategy in terms of natural selection as well. I’ve really only scratched the surface here, and there are a ton of other factors to look at when it comes to lifespan (e.g., BMR, phylogenetic effects, etc.), but if you are interested there is a lot out there on life history theory.",Biology,,,,52,9,,

You can also buy options on the market, which is a bit more complicated. Whoever is giving you the option (the seller) is normally going to charge you a fee for the contact (if you don't exercise, this is how they make money).

Track bikes and cyclocross bikes have really short trail to make them more agile. Big stable cruisers have long trails.

Like gyroscopic effect, experiments have removed trail as a variable and these models are also stable. Here is an interview with a scientist who removed both gyroscopic and caster/trail effects in a model bicycle, and it remained stable.

tl;dr: No one really knows what makes a moving bike stable.

Edit: I guess I should mention it is possible to be stabilize a non-moving bike in a technique called a trackstand. Here's two track racers doing it on fixed gear bikes. Its a bit more complicated but still possible on bikes with a freewheel or freehub.",,,,,93,18,,

And why is it more valuable than other metals, like silver?",Please explain LIKE I'M FIVE. Try to limit economic/financial jargon.,"5,000 years ago humans didn't know much about metal, metalworking, geology, or mining. But they did have a sense for fashion.

Most metals exist naturally as rock. The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they don't look very interesting (to a non-geologist). In the world before the Bronze Age, the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold.

Gold can be found as ""nuggets"" or ""dust"". The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some, you're likely to find more. Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers, so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it, and then looking for more - you don't have to mine it.

You can work gold without heat. It is ""malleable"" at room temperature, which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it won't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things.

Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade. It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club, but you don't get much more head-bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood. So other than as jewelry and as decoration, gold has little practical ""use"" to an ancient human.

But it is pretty. Aesthetically gold looks ""good"" next to human skin tones. Why this is so is pretty much a mystery. But it's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development.

Who gets jewelry? Rich people. In the ancient world ""rich"" was defined as ""don't have to farm"". There were only three kinds of people like that: royalty, high priests, and successful generals.

Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it, and it wasn't good for any practical use, and as a metal it would ""stay all in one place"" and didn't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained, it became a way for rich people to display their wealth.

Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity (it's a simple weight/volume calculation). That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold, of a certain purity, was ""worth"" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat, or slaves, or land, or whatever. It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale, a cup, some water, and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me.

5,000 years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals. Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins, even though plutonium is worth, ounce for ounce, vastly more than gold. Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that ancient humans didn't know about - it's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity. And it still looks good next to human skin.",,,,,84,16,,
