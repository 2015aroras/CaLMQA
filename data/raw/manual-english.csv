I get why stages have multi colored lights to set mood when just certain colors are on. But I often see the full rainbow of lights on. So just wondering why? Is there some benefit versus just white lights (which are also on)?","Former high school theater tech here.

Opposing colors (slightly blue and slightly yellow) are used to light actors with a natural look, one from the left and one from the right. This increases the definition of the actor’s face, whereas a straight on white light will make them look flat and surreal as they will have less shadows, making it difficult for our eyes to perceive details. The same applies to set pieces, which need lighting that is different from the actors to make it easier to see the actors in front of a set piece.

And of course the color of the actor’s skin and the sets also affect the color choices. Then the leads in a scene often are lit differently to make them pop, and actors tend to move, meaning general washes of light are needed to fill gaps.

So, in an advanced production, every mark an actor hits during a scene is lit for them at that moment in the scene, and every thing else is lit to provide context to the setting.

Then the overall shades of color and brightness can be adjusted for mood, and rules broken to hide something or exaggerate a scene.

The end result is the lighting can look like a random selection of bright colors, especially if you look at the lamps during a production while the theater is dark. If the house lights are up, then it is easier to see that the lights are mostly muted colors.",Other,Maybe,,,308,59

Person B argued that while thats true, a lot of the range improvememts now aday are due to more aerodynamic cars and that seeing as a battery is a chemical process, we are closer and closer to hitting the limit of batteries without any significant scientific breakthrough.

Mexico and Central America have plenty of ancient, monumental structures (e.g., Chichen Itza). But the continental US and Canada do not. Why? ","A few do exist. Cahokia (just outside of St Louis) is a World Heritage Site and the largest extant ancient ruins in North America. Aztlan (in Wisconsin) was built by the same culture and is a very similar site, just on a smaller scale. Great Serpent Mound, in Ohio, is a massive burial site on a horizontal scale that rivals Giza, though the fact that it's less vertical and not in a desert obscures a lot of its grandure (trees do that). Speaking of desert, various cliff dwellings in the southwest (most notably Mesa Verde in Colorado) are astonishing in their scope and complexity.

Part of the problem is just geology. The major civilizations of ancient North America were heavily clustered in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. These are great places for a stable agricultural society, but much less great for hard stone building materials like what you need to build Chichen Itza. Most of the places with good access to stone building materials were also comparatively bad for agriculture. The Nile Delta is a relatively unique phenomenon with respect to geology, geography, local biota, and proximity to early homo sapiens evolution. The combination of an arid climate (which helps preserve everything, since rain and humidity are awful for stuff), easily accessible bedrock veins, and abundant access to incredibly fertile soil and reliable water is not something that happens in many places around the world. The Colorado River delta in present-day North-Western Mexico is the closest thing that I can think of anywhere else in the world, and it's not as good as the Nile in any of these respects (and also was first inhabited about a million years after the Nile was).

The Columbia River gorge strikes me as one counter-example to this, though I'm not aware of any large hierarchical societies (a la the Mississippians, Aztec, Maya, or Inca) in that area despite its dense population and fertility.

So yeah… Tldr, the areas where civilizations flourished in North America didn't have extensive stone building materials, so they built earthworks instead. These were spectacular, but they also erode much faster and are in locations where trees happily overgrow everything. You should visit Cahokia though, it's really very impressive. A lot like what Chichen Itza would look like if they had to build it out of dirt rather than stone (I've spent time at both sites).",Engineering,Yes,,,210,34

It seems like it should be pretty simple to just record the sound of a concert grand and play it back on a speaker. In fact, that’s what we do for studio albums. Is it the sustain pedal that causes the main difference in sound between an acoustic and a digital? Or would playing both without the pedal still sound different? I actually own a pretty sophisticated digital piano, the Kawai CA49, and it sounds a lot better than cheaper pianos, but I probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between it and an upright acoustic. ","The challenge is in all the effects of the body of the piano and sympathetic vibrations. Lets break the sounds down a bit.

First, take any single key, that has to have a hundred+ velocity (how hard you hit) variations to sound convincing. A single key press vibrates the soundboard and wood in unique ways per note. It also gets sympathetic vibrations on other strings.

It starts to get complicated when you add additional notes because there are ways those vibrations interact to boost or cancel each other. Wood isn’t perfectly predictable. It was a living thing with different densities across its grains. There is probably even some effect of the air acting as a mild natural compressor, though I think that must be subtle.

And then you multiply that by those 100+ states of velocity, across how ever many notes you hit, each with their own velocity.

So you get quickly to a point where the amount of samples in play would be quite a lot. There are ways it can be algorithmically approximated, and Ive heard recent ones that are pretty convincing.

And all of that is an easier instrument because notes in a piano forte are hit one way. Guitar, for example, you can hit the strings in dozens of discernibly different ways.",Engineering,Yes,Maybe,,597,107

Do the fields of medicine, manufacturing, etc. get adversely affected? ","We will have helium so long as we have natural gas. The shortage is because from the 1925, the US started storing helium in a reserve, thinking airships were going to be a big thing. That didn't pan out, but then rockets became a thing, and they use helium to back fill fuel tanks, so the reserve grew in anticipation of rockets being a big thing. Finally, by 1995, everyone realised that helium wasn't actually that vital, and the reserve was very expensive, so they started selling it off very cheaply. This undercut everyone else, and nobody really bothered with helium extraction anymore.

Now that reserve is running low, so prices are rising again. That's the shortage. It's more of a return from artificially low prices.

As helium prices rise, it's becoming economical to separate it from natural gas again.

What is helium used for? Well it's very light, inert, and basically doesn't freeze. It doesn't even become a liquid until single digit kelvin temperatures. So cryogenics that want to operate in those temperatures, rockets, airships... We'll never run out completely, and there are alternatives. With cryogenics, better magnets are superconducting at higher temperatures which don't need liquid helium, so MRI machines etc will stop needing it.

It feels like every day I see a post about some big game development studio laying off a large chunk of their workforce. What are the causes of this? ","There’s two main reasons that are impacting not just the game dev industry but others as well.

The first reason is that there’s been a lot of corporate acquisitions lately like Microsoft buying Activision-Blizzard (AB). When that happens you get a lot of redundant positions that the parents company can absorb, which means there’s going to be layoffs in the future.

As an example, say there’s a department at AB in charge of hiring / Talent acquisition. Microsoft already has a department that does that, so most of those people (minus a few token employees who know the AB company culture) will be let go.

The second reason is tied around interest rates. That is an ELI5 in itself, but basically for most of the last decade it was super cheap to get money and use that for projects.

Armies would be put together on demand at the request of the King and combined together to form a larger force.

The idea of a permanent standing army didn't come in being until 1660.

Another point is the current British Army is actually descended from the New Model Army in the British Civil War, since they fought for the parliamentarians against the crown it wasn't considered appropriate to call the army 'Royal'.

Back to the 3-body problem. There are certain specific orbits that are consistent, and when one of the three bodies is radically smaller than the other two these are the lagrange points.

That said, a HOA is a board of people who have imposed rules (usually called CC&R's, Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) that you must sign, or you cannot buy the house that is covered by this Homeowners Association.

In this way, it's a lot like being in an apartment or a condo. You have to agree to do (or not do) things that the board decides is in the best interests of the homeowners. This is usually to keep people from lowering home values (the value of your house depends on your neighborhood just as much as it does the condition of your house).

They can be a giant pain, but I'll give you specifics from my own HOA.

Just yesterday, they sent me a message showing that the tree in my backyard has grown over the border wall (I'm in a walled/gated community) out to the main street and I need to cut some of it back so it's just in my back yard. I have 10 days to do this or they will fine me $100.

While this is annoying, something like this is not unreasonable to me. I should be maintaining my house and yard, and as long as I do it, it's not going to become a problem with them.

The gated community shares water service, so I don't have a water bill. Even though I pay the HOA $140 per month in dues, it pays for the gate, it pays for the landscaping (except in my own back yard, but it pays for the front yard and common areas), and it pays for my water bill.

tl;dr - they mostly suck, and I would say if you're going to buy or rent a house that is part of a HOA, maybe look for a house that isn't in a HOA first because even if the HOA isn't bad, the rules are always changing, and it could be bad.",Other,Yes,,,178,32

We have 12 months and 4 seasons, so each season perfectly divides into 3 months a season. With that in mind, why didn't we design the months so that winter is in 3 consecutive months within the same calendar year?

I'm not sure if I've articulated what I mean properly, so let me know if further clarification is needed.","The Romans used to have a calendar with ten months that started in March and ended in December. Then they just had...""Winter""...which was a more vague period that lasted until they were ready for March again.

In time they added two additional months, January and February, although there were still different ways of counting how many days were in each month, so they continued to have shorter ""Winter"" periods before the year started over in March.

The Julian calendar, established by Julius Caesar in 45 BC, firmly established how many days were in each month and moved the start of the year from March to January 1. Most of the months kept their original names, which is why SEPTember and OCTober are now months nine and ten when they sound like they should be seven and eight (because they used to be). Some time after Caesar, the months Quintillus and Sextillus (once months five and six, now seven and eight) were renamed July and August.

The months may once have been aligned with the equinoxes and solstices, but since the length of the year was so strangely variable for such a long time, those fixed points in the earth's orbit drifted over the calendar toward where they are now. Indeed, that's why we moved on to the Gregorian calendar...the March equinox was drifting noticeably, making the scheduling of Easter awkward, exposing a long-term flaw in how the Julian calculated leap years. Our current system keeps the equinoxes and solstices in pretty much the same place for many thousands of years. Yes, it would probably make more sense to start the year at one of these points, and we still could (March 21, 2024 could lead into March 22, 2025), but I say that whoever makes that happen has to also go around and change everyone's computers.",Planetary Science,Yes,,,725,132

Title.

I know to brush before eating breakfast, but does coffee affect this?

Thanks!","You don't necessarily have to brush before eating breakfast. It's just recommended to wait a little while (usually 30-60 minutes) after meals, before you brush your teeth.

Some sources say to do this mainly after consuming acidic foods. The reason being that acid softens your tooth enamel, and so brushing your teeth in this weakened state can damage them. It also helps to rinse your mouth with water after eating anything acidic, to get rid of the acids faster.

Other sources say all foods lower the pH inside your mouth (making it more acidic), and so to wait after consuming any food or drink. The reasoning behind this seems to be that your mouth bacteria consume sugars and starches and turn them into acid. This is a little confusing, since removing these bacteria (and the food they munch on and the plaque they build up), and stopping them from producing acid is the main reason for brushing your teeth the first place. So I'm not sure whether to believe this as I can't find an unequivocal expert source on this. I guess it depends on how quickly bacteria turn food into acid. If it's fast, then it makes sense that you'd have to wait a while for your saliva pH to return to normal. If it's slow, then it makes more sense to get in there quickly and remove the bacteria and remaining food particles from your teeth by brushing them, before the bacteria can do their tooth-decaying business.

In any case, if you can wait a while after eating breakfast, it's totally fine to brush after, rather than before. Brushing before is fine too as far as dental hygiene is concerned, but might make your breakfast taste bad if you eat it soon after. So either way, you want to leave some time between brushing and eating (or vice versa).

As for coffee, it is only mildly acidic and, if you drink it black, contains little or no starch or sugar. So I don't see a strong reason to wait after (only) drinking coffee, before brushing your teeth. Having coffee with breakfast shouldn't make a difference one way or another.",Biology,Yes,,,146,23

","As far as the primary construction crew is concerned the base is finished: It is structurally complete and able to support the upper floors.

Leaving the lower floors unfinished lets you hoist material through them and use the lower floors as staging areas for further construction without having to worry about damaging a finished area of the building, so the interior is usually finished out top-to-bottom.
The ground floor is the last thing you can finish: It’s going to be decorative lobby space (you don’t want construction crews tracking through your multimillion dollar lobby), or commercial retail space (you won’t finish that at all, you’ll rent it to a tenant and they’ll build it out the way they want it), or some combination of the two.

As far as the windows go these are usually non-structural curtain walls, but you need to put them in and enclose the basic envelope of the building before you start installing anything on the floors that might not take too kindly to the weather (plumbing, drywall, flooring, etc.) and before you can do basic climate control (at least minimum heating in winter so when you fill fire standpipes and other water lines they don’t freeze & burst).",Engineering,Yes,,,355,60

If you want armor penetration, you need faster, harder, and longer projectiles. The 5.7 pistol cartridge was designed for this purpose, being a higher pressure smaller bullet. Hardened steel or tungsten core bullets are also an improvement. These still have the regular copper and lead body because it's better for short range aerodynamics and will do more damage without armor, but the hardened core is much more capable of penetrating plate armor.

(I'm American) Inflation is the rising cost of goods and services. Inflation constantly goes up by varying degrees. When economists say ""inflation is decreasing"", that just means that the rate of inflation has slowed, not that inflation reversed.

If inflation is causing money to be less valuable over time, why would it be bad to have deflation? Would that not make my money more valuable? I've been told it would be very bad, but not in a way that I understand","The key that most people miss about deflation is that economists aren't particularly worried about it discouraging consumption. Deflation discourages investment.

Lets say you've got enough money to build a factory. You expect that factory to grow your wealth by 2% a year. Well if deflation is at 5% a year, you expect to make more money stuffing that money under your mattress and sitting on it. So you don't build the factory. Nothing gets made at the factory. No one gets employed at your factory. Businesses around the factory don't get a bump in customers from the employees at the factory.

On the other hand, if inflation is 5%, you would absolutely build that factory. You expect your wealth to drop by 5% a year if you sit on it. With that much deflation you'd even build the factory if you expect it to lose a bit of wealth. After all even if the factory is going to lose 2% a year, that's still better than holding cash.

That lack of investment caused by deflation is horrible for the economy, particularly in the long term.

Now the other hand, if inflation gets too high, it causes some pretty serious problems for consumers. But economists have figured out that a low amount of inflation (around 2% per year) has little to no impact on consumers, while also working to prevent deflation.",Economics,Yes,,Deflation is a reality in some countries,492,84

Same thing for homes - Nielsen is a company that’s been around for over 100 years and they specialize on data collection for consumer marketing. They survey homes for their watching habits, and I’m sure they also capture data on the Super Bowl.

If you survey a large number of homes to find out how many people will be there to watch the Super Bowl, they can average that out for the number of homes that watch it to get a reliable person count. And now that the majority of live TV is over streaming, that’s even easier to do.

Anyone who has worked on mechanical equipment knows there is a specific number of foot pounds required to appropriately tighten a bolt. Is this amount determined by physics, trial and error or ?","So, bolts are usually made from metal, generally steel. Steel is stretchy and elastic, and that's a good thing because when the steel is slightly pulled out of shape, it wants to go back into shape like a stretched rubber band. And just like a rubber band, that stretchy force can be used to hold things in place.

But steel gets deformed if you stretch it too far. You can bend a paper clip a little and it'll snap back, but bend it much further and it holds the new shape. This is bad.

We know a lot about steel. We know exactly how stretchy it is, at exactly what point that elastic stretchiness turns into permanent bending. We know how much friction it will have against another piece of steel. There are many types of steel and we have this information on all of them.

Given that information, there are equations where you plug in a bunch of numbers (the carbon content, thickness, diameter, thread size, etc etc etc of the parts used) and it will tell you the ideal amount of torque.

For critical applications this will then be tested destructively (tighten until the steel bends - note that as too much) and non-destructively (tighten the prescribed amount, stress-test the joint, loosen and re-tighten and stress-test again).",Engineering,Yes,,,287,47
